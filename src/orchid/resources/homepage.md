Hello! This is an awesome demo website made by Annie Don. It's powered by JAMstack technologies: Orchid, Netlify Hosting and CMS, Github, and other goodies.

Thanks for trying out Orchid! Feel free to take a look around, then head over to the 
[User Manual]({{docsBaseUrl}}/wiki/userManual) to learn more about using Orchid to make your site
truly unique. While you're there, check out all our many great [plugins]({{docsBaseUrl}}/group/plugins) and browse our 
beautiful [themes]({{docsBaseUrl}}/group/themes) to see if there's one that catches your eye.

And finally, if you like Orchid, please support it by starring it on [Github](https://github.com/JavaEden/Orchid) and
